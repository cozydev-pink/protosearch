Protosearch
===========

Protosearch is a prototype search library under active development (hence the "proto").
We're currently focussing on end to end functionality, and not yet worrying too much about API stability or performance throughout.

Learn more about Protosearch by reading about our [Features] or [Design Goals].
Additionally you can follow the [Indexing Tutorial] to get up and running.
